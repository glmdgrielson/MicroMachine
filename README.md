Micro Machine
=============

WarioWare style game where the microgames are organized by gameplay style.

Control should be simple: every game can be played with at most
the arrow keys, `Z` and `X`.

Styles
------
- Bounce
	- Gameplay: Basic _Mario_-style platformer sort of thing.
	- Character: ???
- Swap
	- Gameplay: Akin to _Tetris Attack_.
	- Character: Somebody akin to [Dr. Forrester](
		https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Clayton_Forrester_(MST3K)).
		Very much a mad scientist.
- Smash
	- Gameplay: Akin to a traditional fighting game. Z is a punch;
	  X is a kick.
	- Character: A sweet teenage girl... until you fail and she starts to
	  rage.
- Blast
	- Gameplay: Shoot 'em up where you play as a tomato. (This is meant as a
	suitably weird way to handle that the direction you scroll in may very
	from game to game. The tomato should look natural-ish scrolling
	horizontally and vertically.)
	- Character: ???
